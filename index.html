				<span class="box-description">
					The Stack Overflow Friends iOS app uses public data from the <a href="https://api.stackexchange.com/" target="_blank">Stack Exchange API</a>.<br/>
					<br/>
					It stores the IDs of users that were added to the friend list on the phone, and only on the phone, in order to remember the added friends and load them the next time the app is opened.<br/>
					<br/>
					All other information that is consumed via the Stack Exchange API is held in memory, only as long as the app is running.<br/>
					<br/>
					No data is stored on any remote server.
